% Q1.5  - dip_binaryQR2str - Extract the binary values from the straightened QR. 
% The matrix is row major meaning that the correct order is 
% (1,1), (2,1), ..., (6,1), (1,2), (2,2),... (6,6).
% INPUTS - straightened_QR - 258x258 grayscale image represent straightened
%           recoverd QR
% OUTPTUS - binary_vector - 6x6 binary row vector repreesnt a QR

% Crop intial 2-pixel-wide frame
