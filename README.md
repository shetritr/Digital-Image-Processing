## Course content
### Subjects
1. Basic principles of images: human visual system, light and color, acquisition and image representation.
2. Image processing in space: linear and nonlinear transformations, histograms, 2D signals and systems, 2D convolution, spatial filters, gradient of images.
3. Frequency image processing: 2D Fourier transform and its properties, Radon transform, 2D transformation and its properties. 2D discrete Fourier transform and its properties. 2D 2D transformations.
4. Noise correction and compression of images: wavelet transform, PCA, signal to noise ratio, binary filters,
 Perona-Malik operator
5. Color image processing: RGB model, contrast enhancement and sharpness in images, color correction and lighting.
6. Morphological operators: Dilation, Erosion, language detection, morphological operators for binary images.
7. Identifying shapes and characteristics: Identifying points, lines, thresholds, Sifts, Hogs, Hough transformations are classified
8. Active contours, split & merge, graph-cuts, mean-shift, watershed: Segmentation of images
9. Match images: pixel-based matching, character-based matching
10. Advanced applications in image processing and computer vision: tracking, stereo, face recognition
