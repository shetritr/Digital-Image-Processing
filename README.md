5. Color image processing: RGB model, contrast enhancement and sharpness in images, color correction and lighting.
6. Morphological operators: Dilation, Erosion, language detection, morphological operators for binary images.
7. Identifying shapes and characteristics: Identifying points, lines, thresholds, Sifts, Hogs, Hough transformations are classified
8. Active contours, split & merge, graph-cuts, mean-shift, watershed: Segmentation of images
9. Match images: pixel-based matching, character-based matching
10. Advanced applications in image processing and computer vision: tracking, stereo, face recognition
